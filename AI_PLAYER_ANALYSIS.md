# AI Player Logic Analysis - vRacer

## 🎯 Overview

The vRacer AI system is a sophisticated racing AI implementation that combines strategic waypoint targeting, physics-based scoring, and difficulty-based behaviors to create competitive computer-controlled opponents. The system follows a **single source of truth architecture** where all racing data flows through centralized track analysis.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### **Entry Point and Control Flow**

```typescript
// Main AI decision function in src/ai.ts
export function chooseAIMove(state: GameState): Vec | null {
  // 1. Validate AI conditions (multi-car game, AI player, feature enabled)
  // 2. Get legal moves from current position/velocity
  // 3. Compute racing line from track analysis
  // 4. Score each possible move using simplified scoring system
  // 5. Select highest-scoring move
}
```

### **Feature Flag Integration**

AI players are controlled by the feature flag system:
- **`aiPlayers: true`** in `src/features.ts` - Enables AI functionality
- **`debugMode: true`** - Provides detailed console logging and debug visualization
- **`multiCarSupport: true`** - Required for AI vs human racing

## 🧠 AI Decision-Making Process

### **Phase 1: Enhanced Strategic AI (Current Implementation)**

The AI uses a **6-factor scoring system** that evaluates each legal move based on:

#### **1. Progress Factor (Most Critical)**
- **Forward Movement Bonus**: +60 points for moves aligned with racing direction
- **Backward Movement Penalty**: -500 points (devastating) for backward movement
- **Additional Speed Penalty**: -100 points per speed unit for backward moves
- **Direction Detection**: Uses track analysis to determine expected racing direction

#### **2. Speed Management Factor**
- **Target Speed Ranges by Difficulty**:
  - Easy: 2-4 speed units (conservative)
  - Medium: 3-5 speed units (competitive)  
  - Hard: 4-6 speed units (aggressive)
- **Crash Prevention**: -80 points per speed unit² above 4.5 (quadratic penalty)
- **Corner Safety**: Additional penalties for high speeds near corners (>3.5 near entries/brake zones)

#### **3. Safety Factor (Predictive Crash Prevention)**
- **Future Position Check**: -2000 points if next move would lead to illegal position
- **Boundary Proximity**: Graduated penalties for approaching track boundaries
- **Danger Zone Speeds**: Heavy penalties for high speeds near walls (margin 4.0 units)

#### **4. Racing Line Factor**
- **Line Distance Penalty**: -8 points per unit distance from optimal racing line
- **Progressive Penalties**: Additional penalties for being >8 units off line
- **Racing Line Attraction**: Strong bonuses (+15 points per alignment unit) when far from line (>10 units)

#### **5. Direction Factor**
- **Zero Movement Penalty**: -300 points for not moving (prevents getting stuck)
- **Loop Detection**: -50 points for revisiting positions from last 4 moves
- **Momentum Maintenance**: Bonuses for consistent forward progress

#### **6. Start Area Handling**
- **Downward Movement Bonus**: +100 points per Y-velocity unit when at start (counter-clockwise)
- **Horizontal Movement Penalty**: -150 points for pure horizontal movement at start
- **Speed Requirements**: -100 points for speeds <1.5 at start position
- **Acceleration Bonus**: +75 points for accelerating from stopped position

## 🗺️ Racing Line and Waypoint System

### **Single Source of Truth Architecture**

All AI targeting uses the centralized track analysis system:

```typescript
// AI uses consistent track analysis
const trackAnalysis = createTrackAnalysisWithCustomLine(state.outer, state.inner, state.start)
const racingLine = trackAnalysis.optimalRacingLine // 21 hand-crafted waypoints
const targetWaypoint = findNearestRacingLinePoint(car.pos, trackAnalysis)
```

### **Racing Line Waypoints (21 Total)**

The racing line consists of strategically placed waypoints optimized for counter-clockwise racing:

- **Start/Finish Area**: 3 waypoints (speeds 3-3-3)
- **Turn 1 (Left→Bottom)**: 3 waypoints (entry-apex-exit: 2-2-3 speeds)
- **Bottom Straight**: 2 waypoints (speeds 5-4 for maximum velocity)
- **Turn 2 (Bottom→Right)**: 3 waypoints (entry-apex-exit: 2-2-3 speeds)
- **Right Straight**: 2 waypoints (speeds 4-4)
- **Turn 3 (Right→Top)**: 3 waypoints (entry-apex-exit: 2-2-3 speeds)
- **Top Straight**: 2 waypoints (speeds 4-4)
- **Turn 4 (Top→Left)**: 3 waypoints (entry-apex-exit: 2-2-3 speeds)

### **Waypoint Selection Algorithm**

The AI targets waypoints using a sophisticated forward-looking algorithm:

```typescript
export function findNearestRacingLinePoint(pos: Vec, analysis: TrackAnalysis): RacingLinePoint {
  // 1. Get expected racing direction for current position
  // 2. Score all waypoints based on forward alignment and distance
  // 3. Prefer waypoints 2-8 units ahead in racing direction
  // 4. Heavy penalties for backward-pointing waypoints
  // 5. Return highest-scoring forward waypoint
}
```

**Scoring Criteria**:
- **Forward Alignment** (>0.3): +100 points base score
- **Optimal Distance** (2-8 units): +10 points (peak at 5 units)
- **Close Guidance** (<3 units): +20 bonus points  
- **Backward Penalty**: -100 points - distance

## 🎮 Difficulty System

### **AI Difficulty Levels**

Each AI player has configurable difficulty affecting multiple aspects:

#### **Easy AI**
- **Speed Range**: 2-4 units (conservative racing)
- **Path Planning**: Single-move evaluation only
- **Crash Prevention**: Early speed reduction
- **Behavior**: Occasional suboptimal decisions

#### **Medium AI**  
- **Speed Range**: 3-5 units (competitive racing)
- **Path Planning**: 2-move lookahead (disabled in Phase 1)
- **Crash Prevention**: Balanced safety/speed
- **Behavior**: Good racecraft with strategic decisions

#### **Hard AI**
- **Speed Range**: 4-6 units (aggressive racing)  
- **Path Planning**: 3-move lookahead (disabled in Phase 1)
- **Crash Prevention**: Risk tolerance for performance
- **Behavior**: Optimal racing with advanced strategies

## 🚨 Emergency Handling

### **Emergency Move System**

When no legal moves are available (car moving too fast toward walls):

```typescript
function handleEmergencyMove(state: GameState, car: any, difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'): Vec | null {
  // 1. Primary goal: Reduce speed as much as possible (+20 points per speed reduction)
  // 2. Avoid acceleration (+15 points for deceleration, -10 points for acceleration)
  // 3. Prefer complete stops (+50 points for zero velocity)
  // 4. Steer toward racing line (-2 points per unit distance to safety)
  // 5. Avoid extreme accelerations (-3 points per acceleration magnitude)
}
```

## 🔄 Multi-Turn Path Planning (Phase 1: Disabled)

### **Advanced Planning System** (Future Enhancement)

The codebase includes a sophisticated multi-turn path planning system currently disabled for Phase 1 stability:

```typescript
function planPath(
  state: GameState,
  startPos: Vec, 
  startVel: Vec,
  racingLine: RacingLinePoint[],
  depth: number,
  maxDepth: number,
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'
): PathNode | null {
  // Recursive path evaluation looking 1-3 moves ahead based on difficulty
  // Considers future positions and their scoring potential
  // Provides strategic racing decisions beyond immediate moves
}
```
