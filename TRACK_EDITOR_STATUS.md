## üèóÔ∏è TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### File Structure
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ track-editor.ts          # Data models, validation, core logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ track-editor-ui.ts       # UI management, event handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ track-editor-canvas.ts   # Canvas interaction, drawing system
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features.ts              # Feature flag: trackEditor: true
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.ts                  # Integration with main app
```

### Integration Points
- **Feature Flag System**: `isFeatureEnabled('trackEditor')`
- **Canvas Rendering**: `drawEditorOverlay()` in main render loop  
- **Event Routing**: Canvas events routed between game/editor modes
- **State Management**: Separate editor state from game state

## üéÆ USER EXPERIENCE

### Current Workflow
1. **Access**: Hamburger menu ‚Üí Toggle "Track Editor"
2. **Drawing**: Click canvas to place boundary points
3. **Completion**: Click near first point to close track loop
4. **Validation**: Toggle "Show Validation" to see track metrics
5. **Management**: Use track properties panel for metadata
6. **Exit**: Press Escape or click close button

### Professional Features
- Smooth 60fps drawing with real-time preview
- Grid snapping for precise track placement  
- Visual feedback with preview points and lines
- Professional UI with organized tool panels
