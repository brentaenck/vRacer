npm run dev  # Test locally

# Enable feature flag when ready
# Edit src/features.ts: newFeature: true
npm run ci   # Validate build
```

### **2. Version Preparation**

```bash
# Update version number
# Edit package.json: "version": "1.x.x"

# Update documentation  
# Edit CHANGELOG.md with new features
# Edit README.md if needed

# Commit version changes
git add .
git commit -m "🚀 Prepare v1.x.x release

- Feature A implementation
- Feature B enhancement  
- Bug fix C resolved"
```

### **3. Release Creation**

```bash
# Create annotated tag
git tag -a v1.x.x -m "vRacer v1.x.x - Release Name

🎯 New Features:
- Feature A: Description
- Feature B: Description

🐛 Bug Fixes:  
- Fix for issue C
- Performance improvement D

📈 Improvements:
- Enhancement E
- Optimization F"

# Validate release
npm run ci
npm run preview  # Test production build

# Push with tags
git push --follow-tags
```

### **4. GitHub Release**

1. Visit GitHub repository → **Releases**
2. Click **Create a new release**
3. Select tag `v1.x.x`
4. Set release title: `vRacer v1.x.x - Release Name`
5. Copy content from CHANGELOG.md
6. Upload `dist/` folder as release assets
7. Mark as **Latest release**

### **5. Post-Release**

## 🛠️ **Feature Development Workflow**

### **Trunk-Based Development with Feature Flags**

vRacer uses a trunk-based development approach with feature flags to enable safe, continuous integration:

#### **1. Feature Planning**

```typescript
// Add feature flag to src/features.ts
export const FEATURES: FeatureFlags = {
  // Existing features...
  newAwesomeFeature: false,  // Start disabled
};
```

#### **2. Incremental Development**

```bash
# Small, frequent commits on main branch
git commit -m "feat: add data structures for awesome feature"
git commit -m "feat: add rendering logic for awesome feature"  
git commit -m "feat: add interaction handling for awesome feature"
```

#### **3. Testing and Validation**

```typescript
// Feature development with toggle
if (isFeatureEnabled('newAwesomeFeature')) {
  // New awesome functionality
} else {
  // Existing stable functionality  
}
```

#### **4. Feature Activation**

```typescript
// Enable when ready for users
export const FEATURES: FeatureFlags = {
  newAwesomeFeature: true,  // Now enabled!
};
```

```bash
git commit -m "feat: enable awesome feature - ready for users"
```

## 🌳 **Branch Strategy**

### **Main Branch Only**
- **`main`** - Production-ready code, always deployable
- No feature branches - use feature flags instead
- All development happens on main with disabled features
- Hotfixes committed directly to main

### **Why Trunk-Based?**
- ✅ **Faster integration** - No merge conflicts
- ✅ **Continuous testing** - Always building on main
- ✅ **Feature flags** - Safe deployment of incomplete features
- ✅ **Simplified workflow** - Single branch to manage

---

## ✅ **Quality Gates**

### **Pre-Commit Requirements**

```bash
# Mandatory checks before every commit
npm run ci        # TypeScript + Production build
npm run dev       # Manual testing in browser
```

### **Release Requirements**

- [ ] All TypeScript compilation passes
- [ ] Production build succeeds  
- [ ] Core functionality verified
- [ ] New features tested with flags enabled/disabled
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated
- [ ] Version number incremented
- [ ] Git tag created with proper annotation

### **Feature Readiness Criteria**

Before enabling a feature flag:
- [ ] Feature works correctly in isolation
- [ ] Feature doesn't break existing functionality  
- [ ] Performance impact is acceptable
- [ ] User interface is polished
- [ ] Code follows project patterns and standards
