## [2.2.0] - 2025-09-03

### ü§ñ Added
- **Major AI Player improvements (Phase 1 implementation)**
  - Backward movement prevention with aggressive penalty system (-1000 penalty)
  - Enhanced speed management with competitive target speeds (3-5 units for medium AI)
  - Predictive crash prevention system to avoid illegal future positions (-2000 penalty)
  - Racing line attraction mechanism to pull AI back to optimal racing path
  - Improved start position handling to prevent AI from getting stuck
  - Corner approach safety penalties for safer cornering behavior
  - Comprehensive debug logging for AI decision analysis

### üéØ Improved
- **Simplified AI move scoring system** reduced to 6 core factors:
  - Progress toward racing line waypoints
  - Speed management and acceleration
  - Safety and crash avoidance
  - Racing line adherence
  - Direction alignment with track flow
  - Start area handling

### üöÄ Performance
- AI now successfully completes laps and passes checkpoints
- Eliminated AI getting stuck at start positions
- AI achieves competitive racing speeds while maintaining safety
- Effective track navigation with proper racing line following

### üîß Technical
- Enhanced waypoint targeting with lookahead system
- Dynamic target speed calculation based on AI difficulty
- Multi-factor move evaluation with weighted scoring
- Emergency mode handling for extreme situations

## [1.1.0] - 2025-08-27

### Added
- **Car-to-car collision detection system** for multi-player racing
  - Realistic collision detection with 0.6 grid unit collision radius
  - Cars stop when attempting to collide with other cars
  - Visual particle effects on collision (when animations enabled)
  - Debug console logging for collision events
  - Smart collision logic that respects crashed/finished car states
- Extensible collision handling framework supporting future collision types
- Geometric collision detection using path-to-point distance calculations
- Integration with turn-based multi-car gameplay mechanics

### Technical
- Added `checkCarCollision()`, `carPathIntersectsPosition()`, `positionsOverlap()` functions
- Added `closestPointOnSegment()` geometric helper function
- Added `handleCollision()` system for collision consequence management
- Enabled `carCollisions` feature flag for production use
- Maintained full backward compatibility with single-car mode
## [1.0.0] - 2025-08-27

## Development Guidelines

### Semantic Versioning Strategy
- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major feature additions
- **MINOR** (1.X.0): New features, backward compatible
- **PATCH** (1.0.X): Bug fixes, small improvements

### Release Process
1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Document changes in `CHANGELOG.md` 
3. Create git tag: `git tag v1.0.0`
4. Build and test: `npm run ci`
5. Push with tags: `git push --tags`
6. Create GitHub Release with built assets
