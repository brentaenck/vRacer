# Grid Alignment Analysis - Debug Files

This directory contains debug files and analysis documentation from the v6.2.0 development process that fixed visual grid alignment issues in vRacer.

## Problem Context

Prior to v6.2.0, visual elements in the game (cars, trails, move candidates, etc.) appeared between grid lines instead of being centered on grid intersections, causing a misaligned appearance that affected the game's visual precision.

## Analysis Files

### Documentation
- `GRID_ALIGNMENT_TEST.md` - Test cases and validation for grid alignment fixes
- `GRID_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` - Comprehensive analysis of the coordinate system and grid geometry
- `SCALING_ISSUE_ANALYSIS.md` - Investigation of canvas scaling and coordinate conversion issues
- `grid-alignment-fix.md` - Implementation notes for the alignment solution

### Debug Scripts
- `canvas-dimensions-debug.js` - Canvas size and scaling investigation tools
- `debug-canvas-scaling.js` - Coordinate conversion debugging utilities
- `offset-debug.js` - Y-axis offset testing and validation
- `track-editor-canvas-debug.js` - Track editor specific alignment debugging

## Solution Implemented

The solution involved:

1. **Y-axis Alignment Offset**: Applied `(pos.y + 0.5) * g` throughout the rendering system to center elements on grid intersections
2. **Canvas Scaling Fix**: Corrected `screenToGrid()` to properly handle scaling between canvas internal dimensions and display dimensions
3. **Systematic Application**: Applied alignment corrections to all visual elements consistently

## Usage

These files are archived for reference and should not be used in the production codebase. They document the debugging process and can be valuable for:

- Understanding the grid coordinate system
- Future debugging of similar alignment issues  
- Reference for coordinate conversion logic
- Historical context for the v6.2.0 visual improvements

## Release Impact

The fixes implemented based on this analysis were released in v6.2.0 and significantly improved:
- Visual precision and element centering
- Mouse interaction accuracy
- Overall professional appearance
- Spatial understanding for users

## File Status

All files in this directory are **ARCHIVED** and not part of the active codebase.
