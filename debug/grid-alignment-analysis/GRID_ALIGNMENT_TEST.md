# Grid Alignment Fix Validation Guide

## üéØ **What Was Fixed**

The graph paper background grid has been shifted by 10 pixels (half a grid unit) so that:
- **Cars now appear centered on grid intersections** instead of on grid lines
- **Grid lines form squares around car positions** providing proper visual reference
- **All game elements align consistently with the grid**

## üß™ **How to Test the Fix**

### 1. **Visual Inspection**
1. Open the game in your browser: http://localhost:5173/
2. Start a new game
3. **Look at the car position**: The car should now appear **centered within a grid square**, not on a grid line
4. **Check move candidates**: When you hover over movement options (press 'C' if needed), the candidate positions should also be centered on grid intersections

### 2. **Grid Coordinate Reference** 
1. Press **'G'** to toggle coordinate labels
2. **Expected behavior**: 
   - Cars at coordinate `(7, 20)` should be visually centered in the grid square bounded by grid lines
   - The car should NOT be sitting directly on a grid line
   - Grid lines should form a "box" around the car position

### 3. **Movement Validation**
1. Make some moves and observe car positions
2. **Expected behavior**: 
   - Every car position should appear centered within its grid square
   - Movement trails should connect center-to-center of grid squares
   - No cars should appear to be "sitting on" grid lines

### 4. **Track Elements Check**
1. Look at the track boundaries, start/finish line, and other elements
2. **Expected behavior**: 
   - Track elements may appear slightly shifted relative to grid lines (this is normal)
   - The visual alignment should look more natural and professional
   - Elements should align consistently with the new grid positioning

## ‚úÖ **Success Criteria**

The fix is working correctly if:
- [ ] Cars appear **centered on grid intersections** (not on grid lines)
- [ ] Grid lines form **squares around car positions**
- [ ] Movement candidates appear **centered in grid squares**
- [ ] The overall visual alignment looks **clean and professional**
- [ ] No gameplay mechanics have changed (only visual alignment)

## üîß **If Issues Persist**

If you still see alignment problems:

1. **Hard refresh** the browser (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to clear CSS cache
2. **Check coordinates**: Press 'G' and verify coordinate labels align with the visual grid
3. **Verify the fix**: Ensure the CSS change is present in `src/styles.css` around line 1906-1910

## üéÆ **Expected Visual Result**

**Before Fix**: 
```
Car position (7,20) ‚Üí |‚óè|  (car on grid line)
                      | |
```

**After Fix**:
```  
Car position (7,20) ‚Üí | ‚óè |  (car centered in grid square)
                      |   |
```

The car should now appear properly centered within the grid squares formed by the graph paper lines, creating perfect visual alignment between the coordinate system and the visual representation.
