  static LAYER_OPACITY = {
    PAPER: 0.85,
    TRACK: 0.30,
    RACING_ELEMENTS: 0.90,
    DEBUG: 0.70
  }

  drawPaperLayer(ctx) {
    ctx.globalAlpha = this.LAYER_OPACITY.PAPER
    // Warm paper background with graph grid visibility
  }
}
```

#### **3. Enhanced Visual Cohesion**

## üîß v2.2.2 - Racing Direction Terminology Standardization
*Released: January 4, 2025*

### **‚úÖ Release Summary**

**Release Type**: Patch release (2.2.1 ‚Üí 2.2.2)  
**Focus**: Critical bug fix for inconsistent racing direction terminology throughout codebase

### **üö® Major Issue Resolved**

#### **The Problem: Conflicting Racing Direction Labels**
The codebase contained a critical inconsistency where different modules labeled the same racing direction with opposite terminology:
- **track-analysis.ts**: Called the racing direction "clockwise" but implemented counter-clockwise waypoints
- **game.ts**: Called it "counter-clockwise" but described clockwise movement patterns
- **ai.ts**: Used mixed terminology that didn't match the actual implementation
- **Fallback logic**: Had backwards direction vectors for Top/Bottom track sections

#### **The Root Cause**
Analysis of the actual waypoint sequence revealed the true racing pattern:
- **Start** (7,20) ‚Üí **DOWN** (7,23‚Üí7,26‚Üí8,28) ‚Üí **RIGHT** (18,29‚Üí25,29‚Üí32,29) ‚Üí **UP** (41,17‚Üí41,14‚Üí38,8) ‚Üí **LEFT** (25,6‚Üí20,6‚Üí15,6) ‚Üí **back to start**
- This sequence is definitively **COUNTER-CLOCKWISE** movement

### **üîß Comprehensive Fixes Applied**

#### **1. track-analysis.ts Standardization**
- ‚úÖ Changed `racingDirection` from `'clockwise'` to `'counter-clockwise'`
- ‚úÖ Updated all safe zone direction comments to match counter-clockwise flow
- ‚úÖ **Critical Fix**: Corrected Top/Bottom direction vectors in fallback logic:
  - **Top**: Now correctly goes LEFT `{x: -1, y: 0.3}` (was wrongly going RIGHT)
  - **Bottom**: Now correctly goes RIGHT `{x: 1, y: -0.3}` (was wrongly going LEFT)
- ‚úÖ Fixed lap validation crossing direction logic

#### **2. game.ts Comment Corrections**
- ‚úÖ Fixed counter-clockwise description from "up ‚Üí right ‚Üí down ‚Üí left" to "down ‚Üí right ‚Üí up ‚Üí left"
- ‚úÖ Updated visual arrow comments to describe "COUNTER-CLOCKWISE direction"
- ‚úÖ Corrected lap validation comments for proper directional flow

#### **3. ai.ts Terminology Alignment**
- ‚úÖ Updated mock analysis to use `'counter-clockwise'` racing direction
- ‚úÖ Fixed all track position logic comments (Left: go down, Right: go up, Top: go left, Bottom: go right)
- ‚úÖ Corrected velocity alignment calculations for counter-clockwise flow
- ‚úÖ Updated start position handling comments

### **üéØ Impact on Game Functionality**

**Before Fix**:
- ‚ùå AI directional guidance potentially conflicted with actual waypoint implementation
- ‚ùå Confusing developer experience with contradictory comments
