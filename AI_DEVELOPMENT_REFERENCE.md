# AI Development Quick Reference - vRacer

## 🎯 Current AI Status (Post-Improvement)
- ✅ **Medium AI**: Completes full laps reliably
- ✅ **Hard AI**: Completes full laps reliably  
- ⚠️ **Easy AI**: May need additional testing/tuning
- 🏁 **Racing Line**: Optimized 25-waypoint version proven effective

## 🔧 Key Configuration Points

### Speed Limits (Conservative for Stability)
```typescript
// In src/ai.ts - scoreSimplifiedMove()
case 'easy': targetSpeedRange = [1, 2.5]
case 'medium': targetSpeedRange = [1, 3] 
case 'hard': targetSpeedRange = [2, 3.5]

// Crash prevention speed limit
const CRASH_PREVENTION_SPEED = 3.0
```

### Safety Margins
```typescript
// Boundary awareness zones
const OUTER_MARGIN_1 = 6.0  // First warning
const OUTER_MARGIN_2 = 4.0  // Second warning  
const OUTER_MARGIN_3 = 2.5  // Critical danger
```

### Racing Line Location
```typescript
// File: src/track-analysis.ts
// Function: analyzeTrack()
// Array: optimalRacingLine (lines 145-187)
```

## 🧪 Testing Commands

### Manual Testing
```bash
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
# Create multi-car race with AI
# Monitor console for debug logs
```

### Automated Testing Framework
```bash
node ai-testing-framework.js    # Mock AI testing (limited accuracy)
node test-real-ai.js           # Real AI testing (needs TypeScript compilation)
```

## 🎛️ Feature Flags for AI

### Current Settings (src/features.ts)
```typescript
debugMode: true,        // Shows AI decision logging
aiPlayers: true,        // Enables AI functionality  
multiCarSupport: true,  // Required for AI vs human racing
```

## 📊 Performance Tuning Guidelines

### If AI Performance is Too Conservative:
1. **Gradually increase speed limits** (0.5 unit increments)
2. **Reduce safety margins** (0.5 unit decrements)  
3. **Test after each change** to ensure lap completion maintained

### If AI Starts Failing Again:
1. **Check console logs** for failure patterns
2. **Reduce speeds** to previous working values
3. **Increase safety margins** 
4. **Validate with multiple test runs**

## 🔍 Debug Information Available

### Console Logging (when debugMode: true)
- **AI decision details**: Move scoring, target selection
- **Safety warnings**: Boundary proximity, speed issues
- **Emergency handling**: When fallback systems activate
- **Racing line targeting**: Which waypoints AI is aiming for

### Debug Visualization (in browser)
- **Racing line waypoints**: Color-coded by corner type
- **AI target lines**: Show which waypoint each AI targets
- **Speed indicators**: Target speeds at each waypoint
- **Brake zone markers**: Visual brake zone identification

## 🚀 Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Performance Improvements
- **Speed optimization**: Gradually increase limits as stability permits
- **Racing line refinement**: Fine-tune waypoint positions and speeds
- **Difficulty differentiation**: More distinct behaviors per difficulty

### Advanced Features  
- **Multi-turn planning**: Re-enable path planning for strategic decisions
- **Collision avoidance**: Enhanced multi-car racing dynamics
- **Adaptive behavior**: AI that learns from racing patterns
- **Strategic racing**: Position-based decision making

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Don't Break What's Working
- **Test thoroughly** before making changes to working AI
- **Make incremental changes** rather than large modifications  
- **Always validate** with actual gameplay, not just automated tests
- **Keep backups** of known-working configurations

### Architecture Benefits
- **Single source of truth**: Racing line changes affect all AI automatically
- **Comprehensive safety**: Multiple fallback systems prevent crashes
- **Debug transparency**: Full visibility into AI decision making
- **Testing infrastructure**: Tools available for systematic validation
