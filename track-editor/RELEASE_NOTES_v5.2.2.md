# vRacer Track Editor v5.2.2 Release Notes

**Release Date**: January 22, 2025  
**Release Type**: Minor - Bug Fixes and Improvements

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### ✅ Fixed Coordinate System Alignment
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed coordinate system mismatch between track editor and main vRacer game
- Track editor now uses same top-left origin coordinate system as the main game
- Mouse coordinates and grid positions now align correctly
- Grid position display shows accurate coordinates (upper-left corner now shows ~(0,0) instead of offset values)

### 🏎️ Racing Line Editor Fixes
- **Fixed waypoint hit detection**: Corrected hit radius from 8 grid units to 0.4 grid units (8 pixels)
- **Fixed tool event handling**: Racing line tools now work independently from track tools
- **Fixed tool UI states**: Racing line tool buttons properly show active states
- **Improved tool separation**: Select, Add, and Delete tools now function correctly in racing mode

### 🆕 Enhanced New Track Functionality
- **Complete track clearing**: "New Track" button now properly clears ALL track elements
- Fixed issue where start/finish lines, checkpoints, and other elements persisted after creating new track
- Resets all editor state, validation results, and metadata
- Provides truly blank slate for new track creation

### 🔧 Technical Improvements
- **Coordinate conversion**: Updated `screenToGrid` and `gridToScreen` functions to match main game
- **Event handling**: Separated track tools and racing line tools to prevent conflicts
- **State management**: Improved editor state clearing and reset functionality
- **Tool UI updates**: Fixed active state management for both tool sets

## 🚀 User Experience Improvements

### **Track Design Mode**
- All existing track design tools working correctly
- Coordinate display shows accurate grid positions
- Mouse interactions align with visual feedback

### **Racing Line Mode** 
- **Select Tool**: Click to select waypoints, drag to move them ✅
- **Add Tool**: Double-click to add waypoints at precise locations ✅  
- **Delete Tool**: Click waypoints to delete them ✅

## 🔧 Data Compatibility

### **Racing Line Structure**
- Confirmed perfect compatibility between track editor and main vRacer game
- Waypoint data structure matches exactly:
  ```javascript
  {
    pos: { x: number, y: number },
    targetSpeed: number,
    brakeZone: boolean,
    cornerType: 'straight' | 'entry' | 'apex' | 'exit',
    safeZone: 'left' | 'right' | 'top' | 'bottom'
  }
  ```
- Smart insertion logic maintains proper waypoint order
- Exported tracks work seamlessly with main game

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

1. **Coordinate System**: Fixed major coordinate mismatch between editor and game
2. **Racing Line Tools**: Fixed all tool functionality (select, add, delete)
3. **Hit Detection**: Fixed waypoint selection precision
4. **New Track**: Fixed incomplete clearing of track elements
5. **Tool States**: Fixed active state display for racing line tools
6. **Event Handling**: Fixed tool conflicts between track and racing modes

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

- Test coordinate accuracy by checking grid position display in upper-left corner
- Test racing line tools: select, add, delete waypoints in racing mode
- Test "New Track" functionality ensures complete clearing
- Test exported tracks work correctly in main vRacer game
