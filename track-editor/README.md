# vRacer Unified Track & Racing Line Editor

A professional, standalone editor for creating custom racing tracks and optimal racing lines for the vRacer game.

## 🎯 Overview

This unified editor combines track geometry design with racing line creation in a single, powerful tool. Unlike the previous embedded editor, this standalone approach provides:

- **Professional canvas-based editing** with full-screen workspace
- **Unified workflow** from track design to racing line optimization
- **Clean data exchange** via JSON track packages
- **Zero conflicts** with the main game - complete isolation
- **Specialized UI** optimized for design tasks

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Core Track Design
- **Canvas-based drawing** with click-to-place point system
- **Snap-to-grid** for precise alignment (configurable grid size)
- **Boundary tools** for outer track boundaries and inner holes/obstacles
- **Real-time preview** with visual feedback during editing
- **Track templates** (oval, figure-8, circuits, blank canvas)

### ✅ Professional Tools
- **Multiple edit modes**: Track Design, Racing Line, Preview
- **Tool palette**: Pen, Eraser, Move, Start/Finish line placement
- **Viewport controls**: Zoom, pan, fit view, reset view
- **Grid system**: Toggle grid display, snap-to-grid precision
- **Visual options**: Show/hide track bounds, racing line, waypoints

### ✅ Track Properties
- **Metadata management**: Name, author, difficulty, description
- **Track validation** with real-time error/warning feedback
- **Statistics display**: Point counts, track length, complexity metrics
- **Professional track packaging** with complete metadata

### 🚧 Racing Line Integration (In Development)
- **Waypoint management**: Click to add, drag to move racing line points
- **Speed optimization**: Target speeds, brake zones, corner types
- **Visual feedback**: Color-coded waypoints based on speed
- **Safe zone assignment**: Left/right/top/bottom positioning

### 🚧 Import/Export System (In Development)
- **JSON track packages**: Complete tracks with racing lines
- **File management**: Save/load tracks locally
- **Template system**: Quick track generation
- **Export formats**: JSON primary, TypeScript code generation

## 🎮 Quick Start

### Opening the Editor
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser
2. The editor loads with a blank canvas ready for track design

### Basic Track Creation Workflow
1. **Design Track Geometry**:
   - Click "Track Design" mode (or press `1`)
   - Select "Pen" tool (or press `P`)
   - Click to place points for outer track boundary
   - Click near first point to close the track loop
   
2. **Create Racing Line** (optional):
   - Click "Racing Line" mode (or press `2`)
   - Double-click to add racing waypoints
   - Select waypoints to adjust speed and properties
   
3. **Export Track**:
   - Click "Export" button to save as JSON file
   - Import into main vRacer game for racing

## ⌨️ Keyboard Shortcuts

### Mode Switching

- `2` - Racing Line mode  
- `3` - Preview mode

### Track Tools
- `P` - Pen tool (draw boundaries)
- `E` - Eraser tool
- `M` - Move tool
- `S` - Start/Finish line tool

### View Controls
- `G` - Toggle grid display
- `Escape` - Deselect/cancel current operation

### Viewport

## 🤝 Integration with vRacer

The unified editor is designed to work seamlessly with the main vRacer game:

1. **Track Packages**: Complete tracks are exported as JSON files
2. **Import System**: Main game will load track packages for racing
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Supports existing racing line format
4. **Clean Separation**: Editor runs independently - zero game conflicts

## 🔧 Technical Notes

### Browser Requirements
- Modern browser with HTML5 Canvas support
- ES6 JavaScript features (arrow functions, destructuring, etc.)
- localStorage for track saving (optional)

### Performance Considerations
- Optimized canvas rendering for smooth 60fps editing
- Efficient redraw system - only renders when needed
- Handles complex tracks with 100+ points smoothly

### Development
- No build system required - pure HTML/CSS/JS
- Modular architecture for easy extension
- Professional code organization following vRacer patterns
