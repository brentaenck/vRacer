- Viewport controls (zoom, pan, fit, reset)
- Basic track templates (oval, blank canvas)
- Real-time validation and JSON output

### **Phase 2: Advanced Tools** ‚úÖ
- **Pen Tool**: Click-to-place boundary point creation
- **Eraser Tool**: Point removal with hover feedback
- **Move Tool**: Drag-and-drop point repositioning
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover highlights, selection states
- **Loop Closure**: Automatic boundary closing with visual feedback
- **Grid Snapping**: Precise point placement alignment

### **Phase 3: File Management System** ‚úÖ 
- **Complete CRUD Operations**: New, Load, Import, Save, Export, Delete
- **Local Storage**: Browser-based track persistence
- **JSON Import/Export**: Cross-device/browser track sharing
- **Track Management**: Individual deletion and bulk clearing
- **Auto-Save**: Background saving every 30 seconds
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Full workflow coverage (Ctrl+N/O/I/M/S/E)
- **Data Integrity**: Boundary closure preservation across save/load

### **Phase 4: Racing Line Integration** ‚úÖ
- **Complete Waypoint Management**: CRUD operations with interactive editing

6. **Professional Property Editor**: Speed, brake zone, corner type, safe zone controls
7. **Real-Time Validation**: Track boundary and racing line validation
8. **User Experience**: Intuitive tools with comprehensive keyboard shortcuts

### **üöß Phase 5 Implementation Targets**
1. **Start/Finish Line Tool**: Button exists, needs functional implementation
2. **Advanced Templates**: Basic oval exists, need Figure-8, GP Circuit, etc.
3. **Undo/Redo System**: Architecture planning needed for editing history

### **üìã Future Enhancements**
1. **Advanced Track Validation**: Track width analysis, intersection detection
2. **Performance Optimization**: Large track handling and rendering improvements
3. **Enhanced UX**: Additional keyboard shortcuts and workflow refinements
