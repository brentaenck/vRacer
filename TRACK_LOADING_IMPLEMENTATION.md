## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **New Components Added:**

1. **`src/track-loader.ts`** - Track loading and conversion system
2. **Enhanced `src/dropdown-menu.ts`** - Track management UI
3. **Updated `src/game.ts`** - Custom track support in game creation
4. **Enhanced `src/track-editor-integration/`** - Real track import/export

### **Key Features:**

- ✅ **Track Validation**: Ensures imported tracks have valid geometry
- ✅ **Format Conversion**: Converts track editor format to game format
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for invalid tracks
- ✅ **Automatic Wall Generation**: Creates collision walls from track boundaries
- ✅ **Start Line Handling**: Uses custom start lines or generates defaults
- ✅ **Multi-format Support**: Works with both legacy and modern track formats

## 🎮 **Supported Track Format**

```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "name": "My Custom Track",
    "author": "Track Designer", 
    "description": "A challenging oval track",
    "difficulty": "Hard"
  },
  "track": {
    "outer": [
      {"x": 10, "y": 10},
      {"x": 50, "y": 10},
      {"x": 50, "y": 40},
      {"x": 10, "y": 40}
    ],
    "inner": [
      {"x": 20, "y": 20},
      {"x": 40, "y": 20},
      {"x": 40, "y": 30}, 
      {"x": 20, "y": 30}
    ],
    "startLine": {
      "a": {"x": 10, "y": 25},
      "b": {"x": 20, "y": 25}
    }
  },
  "racingLine": {
    "waypoints": [...],
    "direction": "counter-clockwise"
  }
}
```

## 🔄 **Complete Workflow Examples**

- **Keyboard shortcuts remain**: R-reset, G-grid, etc.
- **Same racing physics** regardless of track

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **Track Validation**
- **Geometry validation**: Ensures track boundaries are closed loops
- **Point validation**: Verifies all coordinates are valid numbers
