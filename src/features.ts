/**
 * Feature Flags for vRacer
 * 
 * This file contains feature flags for trunk-based development.
 * Enable/disable features here to control what's active in the game.
 * 
 * PHASE 1 CLEANUP COMPLETE (2025-01-22) - v6.0.1:
 * - REMOVED: improvedControls (enhanced keyboard/mouse controls now core functionality)
 * - REMOVED: multiCarSupport (multi-player racing now core architecture) 
 * - REMOVED: stopOnCrash (crash behavior always enabled)
 * - REMOVED: soundEffects (audio system completely removed)
 * 
 * PHASE 2 CLEANUP COMPLETE (2025-01-22) - v6.0.2:
 * - REMOVED: graphPaperGrid (dead code - coordinate labels controlled by showGrid state)
 * - REMOVED: performanceMetrics (dead code - performance tracking controlled by debugMode)
 * - REMOVED: carCollisions (car collision system now always enabled - 3+ months stable)
 * 
 * Guidelines:
 * - Keep features disabled until they're ready for testing
 * - Use descriptive names and comments
 * - Remove flags once features are stable and always-on
 * - Current flags focus on active development and experimental features
